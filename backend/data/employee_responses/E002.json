      "answer": "When a production issue occurs, I first assess the impact and prioritize user-facing problems. I analyze application logs, monitoring dashboards, and recent deployments to identify the root cause. If needed, I reproduce the issue locally or in a staging environment. Once identified, I implement a fix, validate it with tests, and deploy it carefully. After resolution, I document the incident and add preventive measures such as monitoring alerts or automated tests to avoid similar issues in the future.",
